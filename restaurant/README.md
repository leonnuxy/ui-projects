## Features

- Responsive design that looks great on all devices
- Modern typography with Playfair Display for headings and Outfit for body text
- Interactive elements like testimonial slider
- Modular architecture with separated CSS, JavaScript, header, and footer files

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML file
- `style.css` - External CSS styles
- `script.js` - External JavaScript functionality
- `header.html` - Reusable header component
- `footer.html` - Reusable footer component

## Usage
